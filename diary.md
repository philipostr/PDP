## Entry #1 (July 24, 2025): *Every great Oddysey has an inception*

Hi there, ye who dares to venture into the darkness of poorly designed compilers, and even more poorly designed architectures.

I am preparing to embark on a dangerous journey, one that I don't see myself returning from without the loss of several limbs. That is to say, I plan on creating an extremely badly engineered piece of software that one as crazy as I could even conceive to call a Python intepreter. Not that I plan on making it badly designed, but rather I plan on designing it from scratch.

My idea is to not do any research on how compilers/interpreters work, nor how bytecode is effectively implemented, nor any hints as to the grammar of the real Python, nor anything else to aid this endevour. It will all come from me, and me alone.

That admittedly means that it will be very inefficient and, as the name suggests of the repository suggests, poorly designed. HOWEVER... my hope is that it works, and that I learn a thing or two along the way.

This first commit contains the initial semblances of an architecture, which I am basing on this [grammar](https://github.com/philipostr/PDP/blob/main/media/grammar_01.png) and [diagram](https://github.com/philipostr/PDP/blob/main/media/architecture_01.png), which are linked instead of attached because they would take up too much space.

These will inevitably change over time, but they may give a good starting point. Either that, or they lead me to architecture hell. 

There be dragons after all.
